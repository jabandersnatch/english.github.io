## ⚠️ Common Mistakes / Errores Comunes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Choosing "Similar Words"
**Don't / No hagas:**
Choose an answer just because it has the same words as the text.

**Example:**
- Text: "The weather was terrible, but we enjoyed the trip."
- Wrong: "They didn't enjoy the trip" (has same words but opposite meaning)
- Correct: "Despite bad weather, they had a good time"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Reading Carefully
**Remember / Recuerda:**
Small words change meaning: NOT, NEVER, RARELY, EXCEPT

- "He always arrives on time" ≠ "He never arrives on time"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Overthinking
**Don't / No hagas:**
Add your own knowledge or opinions. The answer is in the text!

### ❌ Mistake 4: Spending Too Much Time
**Do / Haz:**
If you can't find the answer in 2 minutes, guess and move on. Come back later if you have time.
