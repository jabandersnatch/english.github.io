## ⚠️ Common Mistakes / Errores Comunes

**Don't / No:**
Use direct Spanish translations.

**Don't / No:**
Look at only the word before or after the gap.

**Remember / Recuerda:**
All 4 words might be similar, but only one fits the context perfectly.

- Big, large, great, huge (all mean "grande")
- But we say: "great success" (not "big success")
