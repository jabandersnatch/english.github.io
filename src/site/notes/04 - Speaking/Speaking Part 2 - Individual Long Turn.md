## 📝 Example

**Photo:** Family having a picnic in a park

**Your description:**

"This photo shows a family having a picnic in a park. I can see four people - two adults and two children - sitting on a blanket on the grass. They're all smiling and look very happy.

The weather looks beautiful - it's sunny and the sky is blue. In the background, I can see some trees and other people walking around.

On the blanket, there's lots of food - sandwiches, fruit, and drinks. The children appear to be eating something. Everyone is wearing casual summer clothes.

I think they might be spending a relaxing day together. They look like they're really enjoying their time outdoors as a family."
