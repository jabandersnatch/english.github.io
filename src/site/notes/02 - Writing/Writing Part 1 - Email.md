Hi Tom!

I'm so excited about your visit!

The weather in July is usually hot and sunny, so bring light
clothes like t-shirts and shorts. Don't forget your sunglasses
and swimming costume because we have a pool!

You don't need to bring anything special, but if you want,
some English tea would be nice - my family loves it!

I've planned lots of fun activities. We can go to the beach,
visit the local market, and there's a music festival that
weekend. It's going to be amazing!

See you soon!
