## 📝 More Examples / Más Ejemplos

### Example 2: Adventure Story

**Given sentence:**
"The adventure began when we missed the train."


**Answer:**

```
The adventure began when we missed the train. My friend Tom
and I were supposed to catch the 3pm train to London, but we
arrived at the platform just as it was leaving.

"What now?" Tom asked, looking worried.

I noticed a poster advertising a local festival happening that
afternoon. "Why don't we go there instead?" I suggested.

We ended up having the best day ever at the festival - amazing
food, live music, and we even won a prize! Sometimes the best
adventures are the unplanned ones. We still laugh about that
missed train.

### Example 3: Surprise Story

**Given sentence:**
"I'll never forget my twelfth birthday."


**Answer:**

```
I'll never forget my twelfth birthday. I woke up expecting a
normal day, but my parents had other plans.

After breakfast, they told me to close my eyes. When I opened
them, there was a puppy sitting in a box with a red bow!

I screamed with joy and picked up the tiny dog. He licked my
face and wagged his tail. I'd wanted a dog for years, but
never thought my parents would actually get me one.

I named him Max, and he's been my best friend ever since. That
was definitely the best birthday present ever!
